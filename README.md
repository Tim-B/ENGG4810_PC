A Stellaris/Tiva Launchpad Cortex M4 "MPC"
===========

Basically you press buttons and it plays sounds, cool hu? It can also apply effects in real time including lowpass/highpass/notch and even a very slight echo. It implements a USB mass storage device interface allowing wav files to be copied manually from a PC or via the associated PC software (which can also trim samples and apply effects to them).
